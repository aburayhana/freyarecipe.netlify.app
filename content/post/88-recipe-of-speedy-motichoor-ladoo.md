recipeingredient:
- "1 Cup Besan Chickpea Flour       Coarse   Variety     125   grams"
- "as required Water"
- "Pinches Kesar Orange Food   Color    Few"
- "¼ Tsp Ghee For   Frying   "
- "/  180 Cups + ¼ Cup Sugar     Grams"
- "90 Ml Water"
- "1 Small   Pinch Cream of Tartar   Tartari     Use 12 drop lemon juice1 pinch citric acid instead"
- "½ Tsp Rose Water "
- "1   ½ Tbsps Melon Seeds   Char   Magaz    More or less"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by mixing the besan, a pinch of kesar food color, ¼ tsp ghee in a bowl. Add water little by little and make a batter. Keep aside some of the water(if measured as shown), or make a medium thin batter using water as required. Let the batter rest for 15-20 minutes minimum."
- "Add more water and make a super thin, “Watery” kind batter. Heat ghee to fry the Motichoor boondis, in a kadhai/pan."
- "You’ll need a Jhara for making the miniature boondis, the finest one. Place a stand/container or some sort of thing near the pan with ghee. Make sure to keep a cloth below and above the container. The height of the container should be a couple inches above the pan."
- "On the other side, keep a plate/tray where you’ll keep the fried boondis in. Above the plate, either keep a strainer or a colander so that the excessive ghee can come out. To make these miniature boondis, its advisable to have someone help you."
- "To make these, you’ll need to consistently beat/hammer/tap down your jhara’s handle in the container and the face of jhara should be over the pan. While someone who is helping you would add a ladle full of the watery batter. And the miniature boondis would fall into the super-hot/little less hot than smoky ghee."
- "As soon as you feel all the batter has been dropped into the hot ghee, take the boondis out from the ghee. I mean instantly take them out. You don’t want to over cook them, they’re smaller than a mustard and would cook in a second as the ghee is super hot as well. Keep the fried boondis over a colander/strainer."
- "Like so, make the miniature boondis by smashing/hammering down the jhara’s stem/long handle over the container while someone adds a ladle full of batter to it and the boondis would fall into the super hot ghee and it’ll fry in a jiffy. Take them out and place in the strainer. Keep taking the boondis out from the strainer and keep in a bowl so that all boondis get a chance to leave the excess ghee."
- "After all the boondis are made, let them rest for 10-15 minutes."
- "To make the syrup, add the 180grams of sugar and 90ml of water in a pan. Add a pinch of kesar food color, a pinch of Cream of Tartar/Tartari and the rose water."
- "Heat it up and let the sugar dissolve, and switch over to a very very low flame. If your stove doesn’t have a very slow flame, switch off the flame. The flame should be such low as its closed to being switched off."
- "Add the boondis in and start stirring it. Cooking these boondis is a critical and tricky step, if you cook this less it won’t form into laddos and even if it forms it may remain kinda chewy and wet. If you cook it more, it’ll be hard and all the goodness of a melt in mouth motichoor would be void."
- "Cook it in very very low flame, just until it starts leaving sides. If you had switched off flame, switch it on after 2 minutes to the lowest flame and Cook it till Just Starts Leaving Sides. Once done, switch off flame and cover and let it be like so for 5-6 minutes."
- "Take the mixture out from the pan into a plate and spread it. Add the char magaz/melon seeds and let it cool down completely. You have two options; either make the laddus and keep them for 4-5 hours or let this mixture rest for 4-5 hours then make the laddus. I make as soon as it cools, then let them rest. I prefer to shape and then rest."
- "Shape these into laddus and then cover these and let these rest for 4-5 hours minimum. More the better, but one cannot resist any more. By this time happens, the boondis get softer, sweeter and just like a motichoor laddo should be."
- "As the time passes, and if you had made them before and let them rest which may result in slight odd shapes, you can roll them between your Ghee Greased/Wet Palms again to make them round and shiny. Enjoy!"
