I baked coffee flavor cookies for my husband&#39;s sake, who loves coffee. The dough is soft before it has rested in the refrigerator, so dust your work surface a lot of. What I love about traditional French recipes is that they are all about good ingredients and technique. Rather than adding chips and nuts and marshmallows for a sensory overload, sablé cookies rely on good butter, sugar and a hint of vanilla for a perfectly elegant treat.

Diamants are very buttery and crumbly cookies that are usually rolled out in a log shape, rolled in sugar, sliced and baked.. &#34;Diamant&#34; means diamond in French. Being covered with sparkling sugar granules, the cookies present an image of twinkling diamonds..
