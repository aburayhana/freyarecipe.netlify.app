recipeinstructions:

- "For whipped cream frosting: Add your whipped cream to a bowl (I got the whipped cream from a nearby store) and blend until it forms peaks. Add yellow food colouring, few strands of kesar, almond essence, a few spoons of rasmalai milk and blend until everything is mixed well. Then, put it in the freeze for about an hour and let it cool."

Take two rasmalais and crumble it evenly on the top."

- "Take a star nozzle and put your whipped cream in a piping bag and attach the nozzle to it. Create a first layer of patterns as you desire. We just made spirals. Then add 2 crumbled rasmalais evenly on these spirals."
- "Garnish the cake with just a more whipped cream frosting patterns on the top along with strands of kesar and pistachio. Garnish the cake with pistachios along the circumference! Voila, tasty Rasmalai cake is ready!"
