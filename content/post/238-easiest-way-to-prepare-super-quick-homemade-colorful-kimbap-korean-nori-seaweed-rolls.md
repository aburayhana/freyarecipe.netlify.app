Kimbap is a healthy sushi roll with carbohydrate, vegetables and protein. Also, I like to pick colorful and healthy ingredients to make these beautiful and attractive kimbap rolls, so kids want to eat them too. If you roll up the Kimbap and the nori doesn&#39;t want to stick at the end to close it off (it usually sticks pretty well if the rice is hot), just wet your finger with some water and run a few drops with your finger over the end of the nori. Press the end onto the roll and it should cling just fine. Once rolled, slice it like sushi.
