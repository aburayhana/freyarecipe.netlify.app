recipeingredient:
- "3 Egg white large"
- "50 grams Cake flour"
- "50 grams Almond flour"
- "85 grams Granulated sugar"
- "2 grams Baking powder"
- "110 grams Unsalted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring the egg whites to room temperature. Sift together the granulated sugar and dry ingredients. If you use 70 g granulated sugar + 20 g artificial sugar you&#39;ll end up with nice and moist financiers."
- "For browned butter - put the butter in a small frying pan or saucepan and place over medium heat."
- "After big bubbles form, smaller ones will start popping so go ahead and turn off the heat. Continue cooking the butter in residual heat, taking care not to burn it."
- "Once you have a good colour, put a wet tea cloth on the bottom of the pan so it doesn&#39;t burn. Filter through a tea strainer."
- "Lightly whisk the egg whites. To the point where you have bubbles like in the photo, don&#39;t whisk it too much! If the egg whites are cold, do this over a pan of warm water."
- "Sift in the dry ingredients to the mixture from Step 5 and mix well."
- "Whilst the browned butter is still warm, strain into the mixture and stir well."
- "Pour the mixture into a piping bag and leave to rest for 1 hour in the refrigerator. Grease a financier mold with plenty of butter and preheat the oven to 230°C."
- "Pipe the mixture into the mold until each hole is about 80% full and bake for 10 minutes at 210°C. Then lower the temperature to 200°C and bake for a further 5 minutes."
- "Since these financiers contain baking powder, they will end up puffy with a nice dent in the middle. With their moist centers, they&#39;re just completely delicious."
