Although the standard traditional kimbap is not vegan (as it contains egg and imitation crab stick, or beef), it can easily be made vegan. I actually love ordering it when I&#39;m in Korea at the kimbap stalls, where they make it fresh right in front of you. Unlike its cousin from Japan, maki sushi, kimbap has remained mostly off the radar, especially in vegan food circles. This is partly because kimbap, in its most basic form, is far from vegan with staples like ham, egg, and odeng (a type of fish cake) rolled into the rice and seaweed sheet.
