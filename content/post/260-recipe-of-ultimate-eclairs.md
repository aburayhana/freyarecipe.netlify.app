recipeingredient:
- "70 grams Milk"
- "70 grams Water"
- "60 grams Butter"
- "3 grams Salt"
- "3 grams Sugar"
- "85 grams Cake flour"
- "2 to 3 tablespoons Large eggs at room temperature"
- "1 Crushed almond"
- "1 Chocolate"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the baking sheet and piping bag ahead of time because the choux pastries should be baked immediately after piped. Sift the flour."
- "Put the milk, water, butter, and sugar in a sauce pan and bring to a boil. It should look like it does in this photo when it comes to a boil."
- "Turn off the heat and add the flour in one go. Beat quickly with a wooden spatula until smooth."
- "When you have a ball of paste, continue to beat vigorously and place over heat for about 1 to 2 minutes."
- "Transfer the paste to a bowl and add two-thirds of the beaten egg, a little at a time. When you start to add the rest of the beaten eggs, check the texture and add little by little."
- "When you hold the spatula and the paste drops off it after 3 to 4 seconds, it is ready (you can see a stiff triangle tip on the spatula). Adjust the amount of the eggs as needed because three eggs are probably too many."
- "Put a 1 cm nozzle onto a piping bag and pipe the paste onto baking paper, leaving space between them. Make them about 9 cm long. Moisten your finger with water and flatten the surface."
- "If you want to put almonds on top, brush with leftover beaten eggs (Step 6) and place almonds on top. Press lightly with your finger."
- "Preheat the oven to 200°C and put the baking sheet into the oven. Reduce the temperature immediately to 190°C and bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 170°C and bake for about 20 minutes."
- "These are the baked pastries."
- "When you make slits, make them slightly diagonally to let the cream filling show. They will look better this way."
- "Pipe plenty of cream inside. Sprinkle with icing sugar and chocolate to your liking."
- "They&#39;re ready!"
- "Make choux creams with the same recipe!"
- "Use tasty custard cream. Reipe ID: 1443986 I like coffee flavoured cream, too."

Hello everybody, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to make a special dish, eclairs. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Get Chocolate Eclairs Recipe from Food Network. Cream puffs and eclairs are quite possibly some of France&#39;s most popular pastries, excluding the macaron, of course. Unlike the crisp macaron cookie, cream puffs and eclairs are pillow-y and soft. I like to think of them as pastry clouds because they truly taste like a dream.

Eclairs is one of the most favored of recent trending foods in the world. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes delicious. It's appreciated by millions daily. They are fine and they look fantastic. Eclairs is something which I've loved my entire life.

For frosting, in a microwave, melt chocolate and butter; stir until smooth. Stir in sugar and enough hot water to achieve a smooth consistency. To assemble the Eclairs, begin by piping the filling into the shells using a small round tip. Using a tip is very helpful to ensure the homemade eclairs will be fully filled without making a mess. Bakeries have to chill their filled eclairs, which makes for soggy centers and mushy crusts; you can freshly fill yours at home and eat them.
